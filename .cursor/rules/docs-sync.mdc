# Update project docs when changing the project

When you make changes to this repo, update the docs so they stay accurate.

## DECISIONS.md

- **When:** You make a major choice (tech, workflow, config, or "why we did it this way").
- **What:** Add a row (or section) with the decision and a short rationale.
- **Where:** Under the right section (Product & scope, Database & backend, Next.js & build, Docs & structure) or add a new section.

## DEFINITIONS.md

- **When:** You add, remove, or change the role of a file or folder.
- **What:** Add or edit the relevant entry in the right section (Root, app/, lib/, prisma/, etc.) so the project map stays correct.

## Both

- Keep DECISIONS.md and DEFINITIONS.md in sync: if a change affects both (e.g. new file + a decision about it), update both.
