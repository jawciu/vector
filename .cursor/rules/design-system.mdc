# Design System

Follow the design system rules defined in `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`.

Key rules:
- All dropdowns/popovers MUST use `MenuList` + `MenuOption` from `app/components/Menu.js`
- All colors via CSS custom properties (`var(--token-name)`) defined in `app/globals.css`
- DS primitives go in `app/ui/`, feature components in `app/components/`
- Only add new elements to the DS when explicitly asked
