## Database

This is a Next.js onboarding/kanban app using Prisma + Supabase. After any Prisma schema changes, always run `npx prisma generate` and remind the user to restart their dev server to clear the Prisma client cache.

## UI / Design System

This project uses a design system with reusable components (Button, IconButton) and color tokens. Check existing DS components in the components directory before creating new UI elements. Reference Figma designs when available.
